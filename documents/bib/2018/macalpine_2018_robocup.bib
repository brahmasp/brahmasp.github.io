  abstract={
     The UT Austin Villa team, from the University of Texas at Austin, won the
2018 RoboCup 3D Simulation League, winning all 23 games that the team played.
During the course of the competition the team scored 143 goals without
conceding any.  Additionally, the team won the RoboCup 3D Simulation League
goalie challenge. This paper describes the changes and improvements made to
the team between 2017 and 2018 that allowed it to win both the main
competition and goalie challenge.
