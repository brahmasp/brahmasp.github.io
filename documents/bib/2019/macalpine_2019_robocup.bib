  abstract={
       The UT Austin Villa team, from the University of Texas at Austin,
 won the 2019 RoboCup 3D Simulation League, and in doing so
 finished with an overall record of 21 wins, 1 tie, and 1 loss.
 During the course of the competition the team scored 112 goals
 while conceding only 5.  Additionally the team won the RoboCup
 3D Simulation League technical challenge by accumulating the
 most points across two league challenges: fewest
 self-collisions challenge and free challenge.  This paper
 describes the changes and improvements made to the team
 between 2018 and 2019 that allowed it to win both the main
 competition and technical challenge.
